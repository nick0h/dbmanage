# Email Configuration Instructions
# 
# To set up email notifications, create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:
#
# EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
# EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
# ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
#
# For Gmail:
# 1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
# 2. Generate an "App Password" for this application
# 3. Use the app password (not your regular password) in EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
#
# The system will send notifications to:
# - Requestor email (if provided in their profile)
# - Assigned user email (if request is assigned)
# - Admin email (as fallback)
#
# Notification triggers:
# - New request creation (if "Submitted" status notifications are enabled)
# - Status changes (if the new status has notifications enabled)
#
# Configure which notifications to send via the admin panel:
# - Go to /admin/
# - Click "Configure Notifications" for each request type
# - Check/uncheck the statuses you want to trigger notifications
